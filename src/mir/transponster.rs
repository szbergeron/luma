/// Yes, it's a reference, and no, it's not a good one
///
/// This handles the work of doing inference on dynamic fields
/// given a type. It uses a stepped model, where all assignments
/// to a field are grouped based on staged visibility.
///
/// Quark on every node first runs a round, and tells
/// Transponster what assignments were made to any fields
/// on it within the initial round where the type of the
/// source expression could be fully inferred.
/// Quark also tells a transponster about every time
/// a field is assigned into it of unknown type,
/// and if a dynamic field is read it tells the
/// source transponster that the field was read
///
/// These pieces of information build a value flow
/// graph within the transponsters, and allow
/// for selecting root fields where the most
/// information is known about their type,
/// and where the fewest unknowns are assigned into them.
///
/// This is a potentially "unstable" (though deterministic
/// for any specific textual input) metric, so care must be
/// taken to craft not specifically the most accurate metric
/// (to provide as comprehensive inference as we could) but
/// rather to provide the most predictable and stable metric,
/// where we may group types and pull roots concurrently
/// even if there is a specific root that could provide
/// information for dependents
